      "description": "In this project I execute and fabricate the interior of the camper trailer built in part one. The interior for this camper trailer was designed on paper by the client and given to us to interpret. Taylor Forrest worked hand-in-hand with the client choosing materials the best represented what was shown in the drawing. And I also made some changes along the way as far as colors and textures. The walls of this camper trailer are covered with a Formica  type laminate. The countertops are Corian. And the under cabinets are  plywood in MDF in conservation of excessive weight. Patrick Renolds did all the electrical system based on the conversations with the client and what their needs would be, and the plumbing system is designed by Taylor Forrest, a simple gray water system. Much of the research for this camper trailer project build was found on YouTube so thanks for that!!  and thank you for watching!\n\nfollow Patrick for daily electric tips \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

To be honest, I was intimidated by the design and the wallet\u2019s construction, but did it anyway for the lessons I learned, which hopefully you will as well.  For this wallet making project I used the Weaver 303 walking foot sewing machine.  Of course, I need to make it a few more times to get the confidence in the skills necessary, but I learned a lot. A big thank you to Weaver \u2013 Enjoy!\n"
